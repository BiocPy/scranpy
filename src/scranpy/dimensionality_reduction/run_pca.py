@dataclass
class RunPcaOptions:
    """Optional arguments for :py:meth:`~scranpy.dimensionality_reduction.run_pca.run_pca`.

    Attributes:
        rank (int): Number of top PCs to compute.
            Larger values capture more biological structure at the cost of increasing
            computational work and absorbing more random noise.
            Defaults to 25.

        subset (ndarray, optional): Array specifying which features should be
            used in the PCA (e.g., highly variable genes from
            :py:meth:`~scranpy.feature_selection.choose_hvgs.choose_hvgs`).
            This may contain integer indices or booleans.
            Defaults to None, in which all features are used.

        block (Sequence, optional):
            Block assignment for each cell.
            This can be used to reduce the effect of inter-block differences on the PCA
            (see ``block_method`` for more details).

            If provided, this should have length equal to the number of cells, where
            cells have the same value if and only if they are in the same block.
            Defaults to None, indicating all cells are part of the same block.

        scale (bool, optional):
            Whether to scale each feature to unit variance.
            This improves robustness (i.e., reduces sensitivity) to a small number of
            highly variable features. Defaults to False.

        block_method (Literal["none", "project", "regress"], optional): How to adjust
            the PCA for the blocking factor.

            - ``"regress"`` will regress out the factor, effectively performing a PCA on
                the residuals. This only makes sense in limited cases, e.g., inter-block
                differences are linear and the composition of each block is the same.
            - ``"project"`` will compute the rotation vectors from the residuals but
                will project the cells onto the PC space. This focuses the PCA on
                within-block variance while avoiding any assumptions about the
                nature of the inter-block differences. Any removal of block effects
                should be performed separately.
            - ``"none"`` will ignore any blocking factor, i.e., as if ``block = null``.
                Any inter-block differences will both contribute to the determination of
                the rotation vectors and also be preserved in the PC space. Any removal of block effects
                should be performed separately.

            This option is only used if ``block`` is not `null`.
            Defaults to "project".

        block_weights (bool, optional):
            Whether to weight each block so that it contributes the same number of effective observations to the
            covariance matrix. Defaults to True.

        num_threads (int, optional):  Number of threads to use. Defaults to 1.

        assay_type (Union[int, str]):
            Assay to use from ``input`` if it is a
            :py:class:`~summarizedexperiment.SummarizedExperiment.SummarizedExperiment`.

    Raises:
        ValueError: If ``block_method`` is not an expected value.

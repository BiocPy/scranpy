class CenterSizeFactorsOptions:
    """Optional arguments for :py:meth:`~scranpy.normalization.center_size_factors.center_size_factors`.

    Attributes:
        block (Sequence, optional):
            Block assignment for each cell.
            This is used to adjust the centering of size factors so that higher-coverage blocks are scaled down.

            If provided, this should have length equal to the number of cells, where
            cells have the same value if and only if they are in the same block.
            Defaults to None, indicating all cells are part of the same block.

        in_place (bool, optional):
            Whether to modify the size factors in place.
            If False, a new array is returned.
            This argument is ignored if the input ``size_factors`` are not double-precision,
            in which case a new array is always returned.

        allow_zeros (bool, optional): Whether to gracefully handle zero size factors.
            If True, zero size factors are automatically set to the smallest non-zero size factor.
            If False, an error is raised.
            Defaults to False.

        allow_non_finite (bool, optional): Whether to gracefully handle missing or infinite size factors.
            If True, infinite size factors are automatically set to the largest non-zero size factor,
            while missing values are automatically set to 1.
            If False, an error is raised.

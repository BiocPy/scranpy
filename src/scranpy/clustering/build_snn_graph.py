@dataclass
class BuildSnnGraphOptions:
    """Optional arguments for :py:meth:`~scranpy.clustering.build_snn_graph.build_snn_graph`.

    Attributes:
        num_neighbors (int, optional): Number of neighbors to use.
            Larger values result in a more interconnected graph and generally broader clusters from community detection.
            Ignored if ``input`` is a :py:class:`~scranpy.nearest_neighbors.find_nearest_neighbors.NeighborResults`
            object. Defaults to 15.

        weight_scheme (Literal["ranked", "jaccard", "number"], optional):
            Weighting scheme for the edges between cells. This can be based on the top ranks
            of the shared neighbors ("rank"), the number of shared neighbors ("number")
            or the Jaccard index of the neighbor sets between cells ("jaccard").
            Defaults to "ranked".

        build_neighbor_index_options (BuildNeighborIndexOptions):
            Optional arguments to use for building a nearest neighbors index.
            Only used if ``input`` is a :py:class:`~numpy.ndarray`.

        num_threads (int, optional):
            Number of threads to use for the SNN graph construction.
            This is also used for the neighbor search if ``input`` is not already a
            :py:class:`~scranpy.nearest_neighbors.find_nearest_neighbors.NeighborResults`.
            Defaults to 1.

    Raises:
        ValueError: If ``weight_scheme`` is not an expected value.

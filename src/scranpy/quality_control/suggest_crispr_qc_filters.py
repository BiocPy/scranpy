class SuggestCrisprQcFiltersOptions:
    """Optional arguments for :py:meth:`~scranpy.quality_control.suggest_crispr_qc_filters.suggest_crispr_qc_filters`.

    Attributes:
        block (Sequence, optional):
            Block assignment for each cell.
            Thresholds are computed within each block to avoid inflated variances from
            inter-block differences.

            If provided, this should have length equal to the number of cells, where
            cells have the same value if and only if they are in the same block.
            Defaults to None, indicating all cells are part of the same block.

        num_mads (int, optional):
            Number of median absolute deviations for computing an outlier threshold.
            Larger values will result in a less stringent threshold.
            Defaults to 3.

        custom_thresholds (BiocFrame, optional):
            Data frame containing one or more columns with the same names as those in the return value of
            :py:meth:`~scranpy.quality_control.suggest_crispr_qc_filters.suggest_crispr_qc_filters`.
            If a column is present, it should contain custom thresholds for the corresponding metric
            and will override any suggested thresholds in the final BiocFrame.

            If ``block = None``, this data frame should contain one row.
            Otherwise, the number of rows should be equal to the number of blocks,
            where each row contains a block-specific threshold for the relevant metrics.
            The identity of each block should be stored in the row names.

class FilterCellsOptions:
    """Optional arguments for :py:meth:`~scranpy.quality_control.filter_cells.filter_cells`.

    Attributes:
        discard (bool): Whether to discard the cells listed in ``filter``.
            If False, the specified cells are retained instead, and all
            other cells are discarded. Defaults to True.

        intersect (bool): Whether to take the intersection or union of
            multiple ``filter`` arrays, to create a combined filtering
            array. Note that this is orthogonal to ``discard``.

        with_retain_vector (bool):
            Whether to return a vector specifying which cells are to be
            retained.

        delayed (bool): Whether to force the filtering operation to be
            delayed. This reduces memory usage by avoiding unnecessary
            copies of the count matrix.

    :py:meth:`~scranpy.quality_control.rna.create_rna_qc_filter`.

    Args:
        input:
            Matrix-like object containing cells in columns and features in rows.
            This should be a matrix class that can be converted into a :py:class:`~mattress.TatamiNumericPointer`.
            Developers may also provide the :py:class:`~mattress.TatamiNumericPointer` itself.

        filter (FilterArray, list[FilterArray]):
            Array of integers containing indices to the columns of `input` to keep/discard.

            Alternatively, an array of booleans of length equal to the number of cells,
            specifying the columns of `input` to keep/discard.

            Alternatively, a tuple of such arrays, to be combined into a single
            filtering vector according to ``options.intersect``.

        options (FilterCellsOptions): Optional parameters.

    Returns:
        If ``options.with_retain_vector = False``, the filtered matrix is
        directly returned, either as a :py:class:`~mattress.TatamiNumericPointer`
        if ``input`` is also a :py:class:`~mattress.TatamiNumericPointer`; as a
        :py:class:`~delayedarray.DelayedArray`, if ``input`` is array-like and
        ``delayed = True``; or an object of the same type as ``input`` otherwise.

        If ``options.with_retain_vector = True``, a tuple is returned containing
        the filtered matrix and a NumPy integer array containing the column
        indices of ``input`` for the cells that were retained.

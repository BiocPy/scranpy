class MnnCorrectOptions:
    """Options to pass to :py:meth:`~scranpy.batch_correction.mnn_correct.mnn_correct`.

    Attributes:
        k (int): Number of neighbors for detecting mutual nearest neighbors.

        approximate (bool): Whether to perform an approximate nearest neighbor search.

        order (Sequence, optional): Ordering of batches to correct. The first
            entry is used as the initial reference, and all subsequent batches
            are merged and added to the reference in the specified order.
            This should contain all unique levels in the ``batch`` argument
            supplied to :py:meth:`~scranpy.batch_correction.mnn_correct.mnn_correct`.
            If None, an appropriate ordering is automatically determined.

        reference_policy (str): Policy to use for choosing the initial reference
            batch. This can be one of "max-rss" (maximum residual sum of squares
            within the batch, which is the default), "max-variance" (maximum
            variance within the batch), "max-size" (maximum number of cells),
            or "input" (using the supplied order of levels in ``batch``).
            Only used if ``order`` is not supplied.

        num_mads (int): Number of median absolute deviations, used to define
            the threshold for outliers when computing the center of mass for
            each cell involved in a MNN pair. Larger values reduce kissing but
            may incorporate inappropriately distant subpopulations in a cell's center of mass.

        mass_cap (int): Cap on the number of observations used to compute the
            center of mass for each MNN-involved observation.  The dataset is
            effectively downsampled to `c` observations for this calculation, which
            improves speed at the cost of some precision.

        num_threads (int): Number of threads to use for the various MNN calculations.

            :py:meth:`~scranpy.batch_correction.mnn_correct.mnn_correct`.

        merge_order (list, optional):
            Order of batches used for merging.
            The first batch is used as the initial reference.
            The length of this list is equal to the number of batches.

        num_pairs (ndarray, optional):

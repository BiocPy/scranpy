# scran, in Python

## Overview

The **scranpy** package provides Python bindings to the single-cell analysis methods in [**libscran**](https://github.com/LTLA/libscran) and related C++ libraries.
It performs the standard steps in a typical single-cell analysis including quality control, normalization, feature selection, dimensionality reduction, clustering and marker detection.
**scranpy** makes heavy use of the [BiocPy](https://github.com/BiocPy) data structures in its user interface,
while it uses the [**mattress**](https://pypi.org/project/mattress) package to provide a C++ representation of the underlying matrix data.
This package is effectively a mirror of its counterparts in Javascript ([**scran.js**](https://npmjs.com/package/scran.js)) and R ([**scran.chan**](https://github.com/LTLA/scran.chan)),
which are based on the same underlying C++ libraries and concepts.

## Quick start

ðŸš§ðŸš§ðŸš§ **Under construction** ðŸš§ðŸš§ðŸš§

Currently, it's anything but quick... at least it runs.
More to come soon.

```python
# TODO: streamline the loader:
path = "pbmc4k-tenx.h5"
import h5py as h5
fhandle = h5.File(path)
import scipy.sparse as sp
mat = sp.csc_matrix(
    (fhandle["matrix"]["data"], fhandle["matrix"]["indices"], fhandle["matrix"]["indptr"]), 
    fhandle["matrix"]["shape"]
)
features = [x.decode("ascii") for x in fhandle["matrix"]["features"]["name"]]

import scranpy
results = scranpy.analyze(mat, features)
```

## Developer Notes

Steps to setup dependencies - 

- initialize git submodules in `extern/libscran`.

- run `cmake .` inside the `extern/knncolle` to download the annoy library. a future version of this will use a cmake to setup the extern directory.

First one needs to build the extern library, this would generate a shared object file to `src/scranpy/core-[*].so`

```shell
python setup.py build_ext --inplace
```

For typical development workflows, run this for tests

```shell
python setup.py build_ext --inplace && tox
```

To rebuild the **ctypes** bindings with [the `wrap.py` helper](https://github.com/BiocPy/ctypes-wrapper)

```shell
wrap.py src/scranpy/lib --py src/scranpy/cpphelpers.py --cpp src/scranpy/lib/bindings.cpp
```

# scranpy

The **scranpy** package provides Python bindings to the single-cell analysis methods in [**libscran**](https://github.com/LTLA/libscran) and related C++ libraries.
It performs the standard steps in a typical single-cell analysis including quality control, normalization, feature selection, dimensionality reduction, clustering and marker detection.
**scranpy** makes heavy use of the [BiocPy](https://github.com/BiocPy) data structures in its user interface,
and uses the [**mattress**](https://pypi.org/project/mattress) package to provide a C++ representation of the underlying matrix data.
This package is effectively a mirror of its counterparts in Javascript ([**scran.js**](https://npmjs.com/package/scran.js)) and R ([**scran.chan**](https://github.com/LTLA/scran.chan)),
which are based on the same underlying C++ libraries and concepts.
